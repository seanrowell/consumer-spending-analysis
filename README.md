# 🛍️ Consumer Spending Behavior Analysis

This project analyzes consumer spending habits across various demographics using Python and a synthetic dataset. The goal is to uncover trends in expenditure, identify potential customer segments, and provide business insights that could guide strategic decisions.

## 📊 Tools Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Excel
- Git & GitHub

## 🧠 Project Objectives
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualize spending trends by demographics and categories
- Segment customers using behavioral data

## 📈 Sample Insights
- Gen Z consumers spent 25% more on food delivery compared to Baby Boomers.
- High-income groups showed higher average spend but visited less frequently.
- A regional cluster indicated high entertainment spending in Q4.

## ✅ Next Steps
- Add SQL queries for advanced filtering
- Create a Streamlit app to visualize insights
- Incorporate machine learning for prediction
